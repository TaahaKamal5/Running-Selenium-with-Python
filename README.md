# Running-Selenium-with-Python
#This program runs the chromedriver and goes to hotels.com and inputs and searches for Dallas

The chromedriver can be downloaded from: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
You will then need to route the drivers path on line 7

Selenium can be installed by running "pip install selenium"

If errors occcur, I suggest running the code in a virtualenv
For this follow: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
